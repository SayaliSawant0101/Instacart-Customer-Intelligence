# Instacart-Customer-Intelligence
End-to-end customer intelligence project using the Instacart dataset — combining reorder prediction, segmentation, market basket analysis, and recommendation systems.

# Instacart Customer Intelligence & Reorder Prediction  

## Problem Statement  
Instacart processes millions of grocery orders every week. To stay competitive and deliver a best-in-class shopping experience, Instacart must anticipate what customers will purchase next, understand shopper behavior, and recommend the right products at the right time.  

Without effective intelligence, Instacart risks:  
- Customers spending more time searching and fewer items being added to baskets.  
- Marketing campaigns underperforming due to generic targeting.  
- High-value customers disengaging without timely reactivation.  
- Inventory inefficiencies, such as overstocking perishable items or understocking popular products.

## Project Objectives & Business Goals  
The goal of this project is to transform raw Instacart transaction data into actionable customer intelligence that drives personalization, growth, and efficiency.  

1. **Close the Personalization Gap**  
   By predicting likely reorders, Instacart can surface tailored, one-click reorder lists. This reduces search effort, increases basket size, and strengthens loyalty.  

2. **Capture Cross-Sell & Upsell Opportunities**  
   Using co-purchase patterns and product similarity, Instacart can recommend complementary or premium items (e.g., bananas → strawberries, regular milk → organic milk). This improves product discovery, raises average order value, and builds trust in Instacart’s recommendation system.  

3. **Enable Precision Marketing**  
   Customer segmentation allows marketing teams to design targeted campaigns:  
   - Heavy loyal shoppers → rewarded with loyalty programs.  
   - Steady regular users → nudged with cross-sell offers.  
   - Low-engagement users → reactivated with discounts or bundles.  

   This approach improves ROI and reduces wasted marketing spend.  

4. **Strengthen Customer Retention**  
   By identifying at-risk users early, Instacart can launch personalized nudges and offers that prevent churn. This increases lifetime value and lowers acquisition costs.  

5. **Improve Inventory Forecasting & Operations**  
   Reorder predictions help forecast demand more accurately, reducing the chance of overstocking perishables or understocking high-demand products. This enhances supply chain efficiency and ensures product availability for customers.

## 📂 Dataset & Files  

**Dataset:** Instacart Market Basket Analysis (2017, 3M+ orders, 30M+ rows).  

**Key Inputs:**  
- `orders.csv` – order metadata (user, sequence, time).  
- `order_products__prior.csv` – historical product-level data.  
- `order_products__train.csv` – labels for supervised training (reordered or not).  
- `products.csv`, `aisles.csv`, `departments.csv` – product metadata.  

**Processed Files:**  
- `prior_data.pkl` – merged dataset (~32M rows).  
- `user_features.pkl` – user-level metrics.  
- `product_features.pkl` – product, aisle, department stats.  
- `up.pkl` – user × product interaction features.  
- `df.pkl` – final modeling dataset (8.4M rows, 50+ features).  

**Project Notebooks:**  
1. Part 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Preparation  
2. Part 2 – Feature Engineering & Training Base Construction  
3. Part 3 – Modeling & Evaluation (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)  
4. Part 4 – Clustering & Segmentation (KMeans, PCA, DBSCAN)  
5. Part 5 – Market Basket Analysis & Recommendations (Apriori, Word2Vec, KMeans)

## Methodology & Business Relevance  

### Part 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**What we did:**  
- Analyzed 32M+ orders: basket size distribution, reorder ratios, time-of-day/week patterns, top products & departments.  
- Found ~59% of items are reorders, peak shopping happens on Sundays/Mondays, baskets are typically <15 items.  

**Business Value:**  
- Informs promotion timing and app design (highlight reorders during peak windows).  
- Identifies high-value categories (produce, dairy, beverages) that drive repeat purchases.  

---

### Part 2 – Feature Engineering & Training Base  
**What we did:**  
- Created user features (frequency, basket size, timing, reorder ratios).  
- Built product features (popularity, reorder rates, aisle/department rollups).  
- Constructed user × product features (frequency, recency, reorder streaks).  
- Produced `df.pkl` with 8.4M labeled pairs for modeling.  

**Business Value:**  
- Provides a **360° view** of customer behavior.  
- Distinguishes habitual purchases vs. one-off items, enabling more relevant targeting.  

---

### Part 3 – Reorder Prediction Modeling  
**What we did:**  
- Tested XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.  
- Best: LightGBM (threshold = 0.23) with F1 ≈ 0.45, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.84.  
- SHAP analysis confirmed key drivers: user reorder ratio, product reorder rate, days since prior order.  

**Business Value:**  
- Powers a personalized reorder carousel → bigger baskets, higher satisfaction.  
- Improves demand forecasting by predicting which products will be reordered.  

---

### Part 4 – Customer Segmentation (Clustering)  
**What we did:**  
- Used KMeans and PCA to cluster users into 3 groups:  
  1. Heavy loyal shoppers (large baskets, frequent orders).  
  2. Core steady users (medium baskets, consistent cadence).  
  3. Low-engagement users (small baskets, long gaps).  

**Business Value:**  
- Enables targeted marketing campaigns by segment.  
- Guides loyalty rewards, cross-sell offers, and reactivation strategies.  

---

### Part 5 – Market Basket Analysis & Recommendations  
**What we did:**  
- Apriori algorithm revealed frequent itemsets (bananas, strawberries, avocados dominate).  
- Association rules showed strong product affinities (e.g., raspberries ↔ strawberries, bananas ↔ Fuji apples).  
- Trained Word2Vec embeddings → product similarity captured in vector space.  
- PCA visualized product clusters; KMeans grouped products into interpretable segments (produce, dairy, packaged).  
- Built recommendation prototypes: product-to-product, basket-based, and user-personalized.  

**Business Value:**  
- Supports cross-sell & upsell by suggesting complementary or premium items.  
- Improves product discovery and app experience with smarter recommendations.  
- Informs digital shelf design & merchandising through product clustering.
